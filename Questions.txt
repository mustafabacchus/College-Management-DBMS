and the number of courses offered by that department. The two columns should have headers \'93Department Name\'94 and \'93# Courses\'94, and the output should be sorted \
by \'93# Courses\'94 in each department (ascending).\

2.\
Using the above, write a query to list the course names and the # of students in those courses for all courses where there are no assigned faculty. The output should be \
ordered first by # of students descending and then by course name ascending.\

\
1.\

\
3.\
Write a query that outputs the faculty First Name, Last Name, and average of the progress (\'93Avg. Progress\'94) made in each of their courses.\
